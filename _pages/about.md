I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Department of Computer from Northeast Normal University, China. I received my PhD degree in Graduate School of Information Science and Techology, The University of Tokyo, Japan. After that, I worked as a posdoctoral fellow at Shanghai Jiaotong University. I am currently a research associate professor in Department of Computer Science and Techology at Southern University of Science and Techology, China.

Reseach Interest
======
My main research interests are computer-aided surgery based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Currently, I am working on
* medical image processing aided for diagnosis and surgery, such as image registration, segmentation, 3d reconstruction
* surgery video processing aided for operation and evaluation, such as instrument segmentation and tracking, action localization
* image processing aided for treatment analysis
